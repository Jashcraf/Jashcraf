# Aloha kƒÅkou, I'm Jaren

I'm a NASA Hubble Fellow at UC Santa Barbara working in [Dr. Max Millar-Blanchaer's](https://github.com/maxwellmb) lab studying polarization and high-contrast imaging. I got my Ph.D. in Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona working with [Dr. Ewan Douglas](https://github.com/douglase), Dr. Daewook Kim, and [Dr. A.J. Riggs](https://github.com/ajeldorado) on a NSTGRO Fellowship.

My primary research interests are in integrated physical optics modeling for high-contrast imaging, with a particular emphasis on linking ray traces with wave propagation, and polarization. 

## Software
- [Poke](https://github.com/Jashcraf/poke): An open-source ray-based physical optics platform that uses ray-tracing API's (Zemax, CODE V) to democratize ray data and add more physics to the optical modeling pipeline. (_lead developer_)
- [Katsu](https://github.com/Jashcraf/katsu): An open-source polarimetry package with support for full Stokes and Mueller polarimeters that employ rotating retarders. (_lead developer_)
- [prysm](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm): An open-source numerical optics package by [Brandon Dube](https://github.com/brandondube/). (_contributor_)

## Places I've Worked Before

- Visiting Scholar @ W.M. Keck Observatory
- Visiting Technologist @ NASA JPL
- Visiting Technologist @ Subaru Telescope
- NASA JPL Summer Internship Program
- UH Hilo IfA REU
- Akamai Workforce Initiative Intern (UC Santa Cruz, UH IfA Maui)
- University of Rochester (UR Nano, Integrated Photonic Systems Lab, Thomas Brown's lab)
